Haven't heard about MCP yet? The easiest way to keep up-to-date is to read our [weekly newsletter at PulseMCP](https://www.pulsemcp.com/).

---

This is an MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)) Server integrating MCP Clients with [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/)'s latest & greatest Stable Diffusion image manipulation functionalities: generate, edit, upscale, and more.

Stability AI is a leading AI model provider and this server connects directly to their [hosted REST API](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference). You will need to sign up for an [API Key from stability.ai](https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys) to get started.

They provide 25 credits for free. Afterward, [pay-as-you-go pricing](https://platform.stability.ai/pricing) is very reasonable: $0.01/credit, where 3 credits gets you an image generation on their Core model. So 100 high quality images = just $3.

This project is NOT officially affiliated with Stability AI.

# Highlights

**No learning curve**: This server is designed to use sensible defaults and provide simple, smooth UX for the most common actions related to generating and manipulating image files. You don't need to be technical or understand anything about image models to use it effectively.

**Chain manipulations**: You can generate an image, then replace an item within it, then remove the background... all in a single Claude conversation.

**Minimal configuration**: All you need to get started is a Stability AI API key. Set environment variables for that and a local directory path to store output images, and you're ready to go.

**Leverage the best in class image models**: Stability AI is the leading provider of image models exposed via API. Using this server integrates them into Claude or another MCP client - head and shoulders above an experience like using DALL-E models in ChatGPT.

# Capabilities

This server is built and tested on macOS with Claude Desktop. It should work with other MCP clients as well.

# Usage Tips

- All processed images are automatically saved to `IMAGE_STORAGE_DIRECTORY`, opened for preview, and made available as resources
- Do _not_ try to copy/paste or upload image files to Claude. Claude does not store images anywhere, so we cannot work with those with the MCP server. They have to be "uploaded" (saved to) the `IMAGE_STORAGE_DIRECTORY` and then they will show up as resources available in the chat.
- You can use Prompts that come preloaded instead of writing your own verbiage:

<img src="https://github.com/tadasant/mcp-server-stability-ai/blob/main/images/prompts.png" width="500" alt="Prompts">

# Examples

## Generate an image

1. `Generate an image of a cat`
2. `Generate a photorealistic image of a cat in a cyberpunk city, neon lights reflecting off its fur, 16:9 aspect ratio`
3. `Generate a detailed digital art piece of a cat wearing a space suit floating through a colorful nebula, style preset: digital-art, aspect ratio: 21:9`

## Remove background

1. `Remove the background from the image I just generated`
2. `Remove the background from product-photo.jpg to prepare it for my e-commerce site`
3. `Remove the background from group-photo.png so I can composite it with another image`

## Outpaint (Uncrop)

1. `Extend vacation-photo.jpg 500 pixels to the right to include more of the beach`
2. `Extend family-portrait.png 300 pixels up to show more of the mountains, and 200 pixels right to include more landscape`
3. `Extend artwork.png in all directions to create a wider fantasy forest scene that matches the original environment`

## Search and Replace

1. `In my last image, replace the red car with a blue car`
2. `In portrait.png, replace the plain background with a sunset over mountains`
3. `In landscape.jpg, replace the modern buildings with victorian-era architecture while maintaining the same atmosphere`

## Upscale

1. `Upscale profile-pic.jpg for better resolution`
2. `Upscale product-photo.png to make it print-ready`

And then, if the output still isn't good enough, you can upscale it again:

1. `Try again with better quality`

## Control Sketch

1. `Transform sketch.png into a colored illustration for a children's book`
2. `Convert wireframe.jpg into a detailed 3D render for a modern architectural visualization`

## Control Style

1. `Generate an image in the style of the reference image`

## Control Structure

1. `Generate an image while maintaining the structure of the reference image`

## Replace Background and Relight

1. `Replace the background of the image I just generated with a sunset over mountains`

## Search and Recolor

1. `In my last image, make the red car be blue instead`

## Claude Desktop

If you prefer a video tutorial, here's [a quick one](https://youtu.be/7ceSgVC4ZLs).

Create a folder directory somewhere on your machine to store generated/modified images. Some options:

- `/Users/<username>/Downloads/stability-ai-images`
- `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Claude/mcp-server-stability-ai/images`

And make sure you have an [API key from Stability AI](https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys).

Then proceed to your preferred method of configuring the server below. If this is your first time using MCP Servers, you'll want to make sure you have the [Claude Desktop application](https://claude.ai/download) and follow the [official MCP setup instructions](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

### Manual Setup

You're going to need Node working on your machine so you can run `npx` commands in your terminal. If you don't have Node, you can install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Modify your `claude_desktop_config.json` file to add the following:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stability-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-server-stability-ai"
      ],
      "env": {
        "STABILITY_AI_API_KEY": "sk-1234567890",
        "IMAGE_STORAGE_DIRECTORY": "/Users/admin/Downloads/stability-ai-images"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, this might look more like:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stability-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-server-stability-ai"
      ],
      "env": {
        "STABILITY_AI_API_KEY": "sk-1234567890",
        "IMAGE_STORAGE_DIRECTORY": "C://Users//Admin//Downloads//stability-ai-images"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and you should be ready to go:

<img src="https://github.com/tadasant/mcp-server-stability-ai/blob/main/images/claude-2.png" width="500" alt="Claude Second Image">

### Installing via Smithery

To install for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/mcp-server-stability-ai):

```bash
npx @smithery/cli install mcp-server-stability-ai --client claude
```

## SSE Mode

This server has the option to run in SSE mode by starting it with the following command:

```bash
npx mcp-server-stability-ai -y --sse
```

This mode is useful if you intend to deploy this server for third party usage over HTTP.

You will need to set the `GCS_PROJECT_ID`, `GCS_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `GCS_BUCKET_NAME`, and `GCS_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variables, because the server will store image files in Google Cloud Storage instead of its local filesystem.

Note that the scheme for multitenancy is very naive and insecure: it uses the requestor's IP address to segment the GCS prefixes used to the store the images, and makes all images publicly accessible in order to communicate them back to the MCP client. So in theory, if someone knows your IP address and then name(s) of files you generated, they could access your images by guessing the URL.

## Roadmap

These are coming soon; but PR's are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- `inpaint` - A more precise version of `search-and-x` functionalities, requires mananging a mask to define to area to replace.
- Base image manipulation (crop, rotate, resize, etc.): likely as its own MCP server
- Ability to inpaint one image into another image. Doesn't seem possible with Stability API; will probably want another MCP server hitting a different API to accomplish this.
- MCP client custom-made for image manipulation
